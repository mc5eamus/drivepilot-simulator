## 09:00 – Meeting Start

**OEMagic Engineering:**  
Good morning, team. Today’s session is dedicated to the technical review and expansion of Drive Pilot’s feature set, focusing on “Safe Start” and new requirements. I’ll record the transcript, track actions, and update systems of record (Polarion requirements, risks, and test cases).  

**Sherry:**  
Our goal today is to review the “Safe Start” feature, discuss new requirements, and ensure requirements, testing, validation, and homologation are covered.  

**Fu / Tanvi / Dennis / Pavan:**  
Introductions and confirmations of their focus areas.

## 09:05 – Review of “Safe Start” and Related Requirements

**Fu:**  
- Rooted in **DP-313**: Engage only when vehicle is stationary.  
- Requires manual controls inactive, onboarding tutorial/test drive completed (**DP-316**).  
- Must check auto-parking exclusion (**DP-332**) dynamically at runtime.

**Tanvi:**  
- Requires OBDII/CAN bus feature flag check + compatibility matrix.  
- Proposes requirement for real-time diagnostics & compatibility verification.

**Dennis:**  
- Log all checks and engagement attempts for auditability.

**Pavan:**  
- Ensure logs are tamper-proof and externally auditable.

---

## 09:15 – Introduction of New Requirements

- **DP-601:** Real-Time Driver Monitoring (camera-based gaze tracking, alerts after 5 sec lapse).  
- **DP-602:** Adaptive Speed Limiting (based on speed limits, weather, traffic).  
- **DP-603:** OTA Update Support (secure updates, rollback capability).  
- **DP-604:** Enhanced Obstacle Detection (sensor fusion: IR, radar, ultrasonic).  
- **DP-605:** Regulatory Mode Switching (region-based geofencing and compliance).

---

## 09:20 – Technical Deep Dive: DP-601 (Driver Monitoring)

**Tanvi:**  
Integrate camera module with facial landmark detection; ensure GDPR compliance.

**Dennis:**  
Add **TC-601.1:** Driver looks away >5 sec → escalating alerts (visual, audible, haptic).

**Pavan:**  
UNECE R79 compliance required.

**Action:**  
- Tanvi: Draft architecture  
- Dennis: Define test scenarios  
- Pavan: Prepare regulatory mapping  

---

## 09:30 – DP-602 (Adaptive Speed Limiting)

- Integration with maps, sign recognition, weather APIs.  
- Control module enforces smooth speed adjustments with driver override.

**Test Cases:**  
- **TC-602.1:** Enter lower speed zone → reduce speed in ≤3 sec.  
- **TC-602.2:** Weather change → reduce speed + notify driver.

---

## 09:40 – DP-603 (OTA Updates)

- Use TLS 1.3 + signed packages, backup partition for rollback.

**Test Cases:**  
- **TC-603.1:** Valid update → success  
- **TC-603.2:** Invalid signature → reject + log  
- **TC-603.3:** Simulate failure → rollback

---

## 09:50 – DP-604 (Obstacle Detection)

- Sensor fusion (Kalman filter + CNN classification).  
- Benchmark detection latency/accuracy.

**Test Cases:**  
- **TC-604.1:** Pedestrian → emergency stop  
- **TC-604.2:** Animal at night → slow + alert  
- **TC-604.3:** Static object → navigate around

---

## 10:00 – DP-605 (Regulatory Mode Switching)

- GPS-based geofencing to load region compliance profile.

**Test Cases:**  
- **TC-605.1:** Cross border → switch mode + notify  
- **TC-605.2:** Engage disallowed feature → block + feedback

---

## 10:10 – Validation, Verification & Traceability

- **Dennis:** Update System Test Case Specification & traceability matrix.  
- **Tanvi:** Update V&V plan and simulation environments.  
- **Fu:** Update System Requirement Specification.  
- **Pavan:** Prepare compliance summaries for each feature.

---

## 10:20 – Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Requirement | Risk | Mitigation |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| DP-601 | False positives/negatives | Extensive testing |
| DP-602 | Incorrect speed detection | Redundant data sources |
| DP-603 | Update failure | Rollback + staged rollout |
| DP-604 | Sensor fusion errors | Continuous calibration |
| DP-605 | Regulatory DB errors | Regular updates & validation |

---

## 10:30 – Open Technical Issues

- Gaze tracking integration with HMI  
- Weather data reliability  
- OTA bandwidth in rural areas  
- Sensor calibration drift  
- Border geofencing accuracy  

Workshops to be scheduled.

## 10:40 – Next Steps & Action Items

| Owner | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| Fu | Finalize DP-601–DP-605, update traceability & risk register |
| Tanvi | Draft architectures, assess integration/data risks |
| Dennis | Draft test cases, update System Test Spec & validation plan |
| Pavan | Prepare compliance summaries, coordinate certification |
| Sherry | Oversee progress, align teams, schedule follow-ups |

**OEMagic Engineering:**  
Will update Polarion, send notifications, and circulate summary report.
